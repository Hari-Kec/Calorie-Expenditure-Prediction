# 🏋️ Calorie Expenditure Prediction - Kaggle Competition

This repository contains my solution for a Kaggle competition focused on predicting calorie expenditure based on biometric and activity-related data. The goal is to accurately forecast the number of calories burned using various physiological features such as age, height, weight, duration, heart rate, and body temperature.

## 📁 About the Competition

- **Competition Type:** Regression
- **Target Variable:** `Calories` (continuous)
- **Evaluation Metric:** Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE)
- **Data Source:** A synthetic dataset derived from the original "Calories Burnt Prediction" dataset, generated using a deep learning model.
- **Platform:** [Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/haris2004lskhari))
